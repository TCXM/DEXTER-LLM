# DYNAMO-LLM 🚀🤖

## Project Overview

![image](docs/static/images/the-first-figure.jpg)

DYNAMO-LLM *(Dynamic Long-Term Task Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems in Unknown Environments via Large Language Models)* is a novel framework for dynamic long-term task planning in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to operate in unknown environments. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-time reasoning and model-based optimization for task scheduling, DYNAMO-LLM achieves adaptive task decomposition, optimal assignment, and robust execution.

## Key Features

- 🛠️ **Dynamic Task Decomposition**  
  Real-time task decomposition using LLMs to generate executable subtasks based on environmental observations.
  
- ⏰ **Optimal Task Scheduling**  
  Optimal assignment of subtasks to robots considering heterogeneous capabilities and resource constraints.
  
- 🔁 **Multi-Rate Adaptation**  
  Event-driven adaptation to new features and tasks detected online, ensuring continuous planning and execution.
  
- 📝 **Explainability & Verifiability**  
  Human-in-the-loop verification and explainable planning through search-based scheduling and explicit constraints.
  
- 🌐 **Scalability & Versatility**  
  Supports large-scale deployments with multiple robots and complex missions.
